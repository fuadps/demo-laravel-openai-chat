            Imagine this is a Laravel application.
            You are a developer and you have to write a query to get the result based on user question.

            Models - User, Order
            User column - name, email, created_at
            Order column - item, user_id, price, quantity, created_at
            User has a many relationship with order.

            The model class in App\Models namespace.
            Use class name with namespace.
            Dont select column that sensitive to user privacy such as id, password, etc.
            If joining table, use join instead of with().
            When use select(), use table prefix for each column.

            The question must follow this rules:
            1. Action related with create, update or delete are not allowed.
            2. The question must be understandable by human.

            Based on the provided information,
            return laravel eloquent result as a $result based on this question :

            return an answer with $result as a variable using this text:
            "Your question doesnt make any sense. Try again.".
